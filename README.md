# Q-Learning Puzzle Solver

This repository contains an implementation of a Q-learning algorithm to solve a grid-based puzzle game where a player navigates boxes to storage locations.

## Overview

The puzzle game environment is represented by a grid with walls, empty spaces, boxes, and storage locations. The objective is to move the boxes to the storage locations using the player character. The Q-learning algorithm learns a policy to efficiently solve the puzzle by updating Q-values based on rewards received during gameplay.

## Features

- **Game Environment**: The game environment is defined using a grid structure with various elements such as walls, empty spaces, boxes, and storage locations.

- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: The Q-learning algorithm learns a policy to solve the puzzle by updating Q-values based on rewards received during gameplay.

- **Evaluation**: The learned policy is evaluated to solve the puzzle game from the initial state to the goal state.
